      I enjoy art drawing and it is amazing <cite> Rebecca Cooper</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I have a passion for learning. I tried many classes, such as science, music, fitness, trades, and performing
      arts. I graduated from the Performing Art certificate program. It was an excellent introduction to performing
      music, acting and behind the scenes. It helped with stage fright and presentation skills.</p>
    <p>I enjoy art drawing, and photography is my favourite. The fun part is creativity, drawing what you want, and
      seeing the result. Christmas day December 25 <sup> th </sup> is the best time to do drawing. It is the most
      relaxing holiday.
      In addition ,photography is fantastic because photos are memories of the past. Taking photos of nature is an
      inspiration and seeing the beauty in nature.
      <abbr title="For your informtion "> FYI </abbr> I enjoy all arts.
